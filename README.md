✅ Conclusion & Recommendations (Sales Analysis)
Conclusion

The analysis reveals strong revenue growth but highlights critical challenges related to profitability, regional performance, and discount management. While certain products and regions drive high sales, their contribution to profit is uneven, underscoring the need for a more margin-focused decision framework. Customer profitability is dispersed, and current discounting practices significantly reduce overall profit.

Actionable Recommendations

Introduce discount thresholds to prevent excessive margin erosion.

Limit high discounts on low-margin products and regions.

2. Focus on High-Margin Products

Prioritize promotion of high-profit products such as Canon imageCLASS copiers.

Reassess pricing and cost structure of high-revenue but low-margin products.

3. Improve Regional Performance

Investigate underperforming regions such as Canada to identify operational or demand-side constraints.

Replicate best practices from high-performing regions like Central.

4. Strengthen Customer Profitability Strategy

Identify high-value customer segments and design targeted retention programs.

Reduce dependency on discount-driven sales for low-profit customers.

5. Next-Step Opportunity (Advanced Analytics)

Implement demand forecasting and profitability prediction models to proactively guide pricing, inventory, and promotion decisions.
